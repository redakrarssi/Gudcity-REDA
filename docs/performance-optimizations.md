# Performance Optimizations for Gudcity-REDA

This document outlines the performance optimization strategies implemented in the loyalty program application to reduce database load and improve user experience.

## 1. Data Caching

### React Query Implementation

We've implemented React Query (TanStack Query) for efficient server state management with the following optimizations:

- **Configurable Stale Times**: Data is considered fresh for 60 seconds by default before re-fetching
- **Garbage Collection**: Cache entries are retained for 10 minutes after becoming inactive
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed queries automatically retry with exponential backoff
- **Background Refreshing**: Data refreshes in the background while displaying existing data
- **Request Deduplication**: Duplicate requests are automatically combined
- **Query Invalidation**: Fine-grained cache invalidation based on logical entity relationships

### In-Memory Cache

A custom in-memory cache layer has been implemented for raw SQL query results:

- **Time-Based Expiration**: Cache entries expire after a configurable TTL (default: 5 minutes)
- **Tag-Based Invalidation**: Cache entries can be invalidated by tags (e.g., 'customer', 'programs')
- **Memory Management**: Cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for cached data

## 2. Batched Database Queries

### Query Batching

To reduce database connection overhead, we've implemented:

- **Request Batching**: Multiple related queries combined into a single database request
- **Prepared Statements**: Efficient SQL execution with parameter binding
- **IN Clause Optimization**: Efficiently fetch multiple entities with a single query
- **Transaction Support**: Multiple queries wrapped in transactions when appropriate

### Example: Dashboard Statistics

The dashboard now retrieves all statistics in a single optimized batch operation:
- Total points across programs
- Program count
- Upcoming rewards
- Recent activity
- Last visited business

## 3. Optimized React Components

### Performance Patterns

The following patterns have been implemented for better React performance:

- **Memoization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- **Stable Callbacks**: useCallback to prevent function recreation
- **Virtualization**: Only render visible items in long lists
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of components that aren't immediately needed
- **Progressive Loading**: Show essential content first while loading details in the background

### Enhanced User Experience

We've added several features to improve perceived performance:

- **Loading States**: Clear visual indicators during data loading
- **Stale Data Indicators**: Visual cues when showing cached data
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately before server confirmation
- **Background Refreshing**: Data refreshes without blocking the UI
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff and fallback data

## 4. Networking Optimizations

### Request Optimization

- **Conditional Fetching**: Only fetch data when needed
- **Polling Optimizations**: Intelligent polling with reduced frequency when tab is inactive
- **Prefetching**: Preload data for likely user actions
- **Retry Management**: Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems

## 5. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

### Performance Monitoring

- Cache hit rates are tracked and logged for optimization
- Query performance metrics are collected for analysis
- Slow query identification for targeted optimization

## Implementation Examples

### Enrolled Programs Component

The EnrolledPrograms component has been optimized with:
- Batch fetching of program data and reward tiers
- Cached results with tag-based invalidation
- Optimized rendering of reward tiers
- Background data refreshing
- Stale data indicators

### Dashboard Statistics

The dashboard statistics now:
- Fetch all metrics in a single database connection
- Cache results with appropriate expiration
- Show visual indicators during background refreshes
- Properly handle and recover from errors

## Getting Started with These Optimizations

To leverage these optimizations in new components:

1. Use the `useQuery` hook from @tanstack/react-query for data fetching
2. Use batch query utilities for related database operations
3. Implement proper cache invalidation when data changes
4. Add appropriate visual indicators for loading and stale states

## Future Improvements

Planned performance enhancements:
- Service worker for offline support
- Persistent cache for faster startup
- Server-side rendering for critical components
- Query performance analysis tooling
