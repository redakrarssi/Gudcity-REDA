# QR Scanner Sound Removal

## Issue
The QR scanner in the business dashboard was playing an annoying sound when scanning a customer QR code. This needed to be removed.

## Solution
We replaced the audio file with an empty file to prevent any sound from playing. This approach avoids modifying any code, which prevents potential TypeScript errors or regressions.

## Implementation Details

1. The original sound file was located at `public/assets/sounds/beep-success.mp3`
2. We replaced it with an empty file with the same name
3. The sound will no longer play, but the application will still attempt to load and play the file
4. This solution avoids having to modify any TypeScript code in the QRScanner component

## Additional Notes
If the sound needs to be re-enabled in the future, we would simply need to restore the original audio file.
