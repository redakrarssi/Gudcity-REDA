REGISTRATION DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS
===================================================================

1. In your browser, open http://localhost:5177/ (or the current port shown in the terminal)
2. Go to the Registration page (/register)
3. Open the browser DevTools by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
4. Go to the Console tab in DevTools
5. Try to register with a new unique email and check the console logs

Based on our debugging so far:
- Database connections are working correctly
- User creation works when done directly through tests
- The issue might be in the front-end to back-end communication

Steps to add debug logging to the front-end:

1. In the browser console, add this code to monitor form submission:
   
   const originalFetch = window.fetch;
   window.fetch = function(...args) {
     console.log('Fetch request:', args);
     return originalFetch.apply(this, args).then(response => {
       console.log('Fetch response:', response);
       return response.clone();
     });
   };

2. After adding this code, try to register again and see the request/response

Check specifically:
- What's the request structure being sent?
- Is there any error in the response?
- Is the register function in AuthContext.tsx being called?
- Is createUser in userService.ts being called?

Sample data to use for testing:
- Name: Debug Test User
- Email: debug_${Date.now()}@test.com
- Password: password123
- User Type: Customer

If you need more help, check the browser network tab to see 
if the request is being sent correctly to the server.

SUMMARY OF TESTING RESULTS
===================================================================

1. Database setup is correct:
   - Users table exists with all required columns
   - Email uniqueness constraint is working

2. Direct user creation works:
   - Test scripts can create users without errors
   - Duplicate emails are properly rejected

3. Auth flow appears to be working:
   - getUserByEmail works correctly
   - createUser function has proper error handling
   - Password hashing is working

The issue is likely in the front-end to back-end connection:
- Check if form data is correctly formatted 
- Verify that register() in AuthContext is calling createDbUser correctly
- Add logging in the browser console to track the API requests
- Check for CORS or API-related errors in the browser console
