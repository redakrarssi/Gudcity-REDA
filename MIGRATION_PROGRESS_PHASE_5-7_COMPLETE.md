---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Current State
- **API Infrastructure:** ✅ Complete and functional
- **Server Services:** ✅ All major services created
- **API Endpoints:** ✅ Core endpoints created and secured
- **Client Services:** ✅ Most services have API integration with fallback
- **Dashboard Components:** ⚠️ Still using direct database access in many places
- **Security:** ⚠️ Client-side database access still possible (VITE_DATABASE_URL exists)

### Breaking Changes Not Yet Applied
- Client-side database access still works (backward compatibility maintained)
- Feature flags still in place for gradual rollout
- Old database query code still exists in some client services

### Migration Strategy
- **Phased approach maintained** - Can still roll back if needed
- **Zero downtime** - All changes are backward compatible
- **Gradual rollout** - Can enable API usage per service or per feature
- **Comprehensive fallbacks** - Direct database access as safety net
