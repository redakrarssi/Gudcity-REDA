# QR Scanner UX Improvement

## Problem
When scanning a QR code in the business dashboard, the award points table was automatically showing up. This was not the desired behavior as the business wanted to see customer details first.

## Solution

We've modified the QR scanner components to show ONLY customer details when scanning a QR code, instead of automatically displaying the award points table.

### Changes Made:

1. **In `src/pages/business/QrScanner.tsx`**
   - Modified the `handleScan` function to only show the customer details modal
   - Removed the setting of `selectedQrCodeData` for customer QR codes which was causing the points award modal to appear
   - Made sure both customer and loyalty card QR codes show the customer details modal

2. **In `src/pages/business/Dashboard.tsx`**
   - Updated the QR scanner handling to redirect to the customer details page
   - Removed automatic point processing when scanning a QR code
   - Added a smoother transition with a success message before redirecting

## Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: Business users now see customer information first before deciding on actions
- **More Control**: Businesses can review customer details before awarding points
- **Simplified Flow**: Removes the automatic points award which could lead to accidental point additions

## How to Use

1. Scan a customer QR code from the business dashboard
2. The system will now show customer details first
3. From the customer details page, you can:
   - View customer information
   - Award points (if desired)
   - Enroll the customer in programs
   - Generate promo codes

This change ensures that the business has full control over the process and can make informed decisions after reviewing customer information.
