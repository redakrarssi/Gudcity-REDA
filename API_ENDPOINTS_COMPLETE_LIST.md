## üîÑ API Architecture Pattern

Following the **"12 Functions for 90+ Endpoints"** pattern from `fun.md`:

```
Single Serverless Function = Multiple Related Endpoints

Example: api/businesses/[...slug].ts handles:
- /api/businesses (list/create)
- /api/businesses/:id (get/update/delete)
- /api/businesses/:id/customers (list/add)
- /api/businesses/:id/staff (list/add/remove)
- /api/businesses/:id/analytics (various analytics)
... and more!
```

This architecture provides:
- ‚úÖ Fewer cold starts
- ‚úÖ Better resource utilization
- ‚úÖ Easier maintenance
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective scaling
- ‚úÖ Grouped related operations
