# Enrollment Notification System

This document outlines the implementation of the enrollment notification system, which enables customers to join loyalty programs and businesses to receive notifications about enrollment activities.

## Overview

The enrollment notification system provides a seamless experience for both customers and businesses:

1. **For Customers**:
   - Receive enrollment invitations from businesses
   - Accept or decline invitations with a single click
   - Get immediate feedback on enrollment status

2. **For Businesses**:
   - Send enrollment invitations to customers
   - Receive real-time notifications when customers accept or decline
   - View enrollment activity in the business dashboard
   - Track customer engagement with loyalty programs

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Transaction Handling

The system uses proper transaction handling to ensure data consistency:

- Error handling with detailed error codes and messages

### 2. Customer UI Components

- Enhanced `Cards.tsx` component with enrollment request modal
- Loading states during enrollment processing

- Real-time UI updates after enrollment actions

### 3. Business UI Components

- `BusinessEnrollmentNotifications` component to display enrollment activity
- Real-time updates when customers respond to enrollment invitations
- Visual indicators for new/unread notifications
- Integration with the business dashboard

### 4. Notification Services

- `CustomerNotificationService` for managing notifications
- `getBusinessNotifications` method to retrieve enrollment-related notifications
- Real-time notification delivery using WebSockets
- Proper notification state management (read/unread, actioned)

### 5. Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling system with specific error codes
- User-friendly error messages for each failure point
- Recovery mechanisms for specific error types
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
