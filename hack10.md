# Security Audit Report - GudCity Loyalty Platform

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### **File:** `src/services/userService.ts`  
**Line:** 142, 153, 164  
**Issue:** Hardcoded password hashes in source code.  
**Risk:** Extremely high — user accounts can be compromised with known hashes.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Remove all hardcoded password hashes from src/services/userService.ts. Replace with proper user creation that requires users to set their own passwords during registration. The hardcoded hashes 'a4def47bd16d0a847e2cdf3d2e828bc9594c3e12e57398e45c59fa943dfa61a0' should be completely removed and replaced with proper password hashing during user creation.
```

### **File:** `src/utils/validateEnvironment.ts`  
**Line:** 45  
**Issue:** Hardcoded database credentials detected in validation logic.  
**Risk:** Extremely high — database credentials exposed in source code.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Remove the hardcoded database credential check 'neondb_owner:npg_rpc6Nh5oKGzt' from src/utils/validateEnvironment.ts line 45. Replace with a generic check for placeholder credentials without exposing actual credentials in the source code.
```

### **File:** `src/server.ts`  
**Line:** 199  
**Issue:** Rate limiting key generation includes user email in plaintext.  
**Risk:** High — user emails exposed in rate limiting logs and keys.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
In src/server.ts line 199, replace the rate limiting keyGenerator that includes req.body.email with a hashed version. Use crypto.createHash('sha256').update(email).digest('hex') to hash the email before including it in the rate limiting key.
```

## High Risk

### **File:** `src/utils/csrf.ts`  
**Line:** 12-15  
**Issue:** Weak CSRF token generation using Math.random().  
**Risk:** High — predictable CSRF tokens can be exploited.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Replace the weak CSRF token generation in src/utils/csrf.ts lines 12-15. Use crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex') instead of Math.random() for cryptographically secure token generation. Add proper fallback for environments without crypto.randomBytes.
```

### **File:** `src/services/authService.ts`  
**Line:** 453-470  
**Issue:** Password hashing uses dynamic import which can fail silently.  
**Risk:** High — password hashing failures may not be properly handled.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
In src/services/authService.ts, replace the dynamic bcrypt import with a static import at the top of the file. Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for password hashing failures. Ensure the function always returns a hashed password or throws a clear error.
```

### **File:** `src/utils/helmetPolyfill.ts`  
**Line:** 35-36  
**Issue:** Content Security Policy allows 'unsafe-inline' for styles.  
**Risk:** High — XSS attacks possible through inline styles.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
In src/utils/helmetPolyfill.ts, remove 'unsafe-inline' from the style-src directive. Use nonces or hashes for inline styles instead. Update the CSP to: "style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com" and implement proper nonce generation for any required inline styles.
```

### **File:** `src/api/businessRoutes.ts`  
**Line:** 67-75  
**Issue:** SQL query uses template literals without proper parameterization.  
**Risk:** High — potential SQL injection vulnerability.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
In src/api/businessRoutes.ts, ensure all SQL queries use proper parameterized queries with the sql template literal. Replace any string concatenation in SQL queries with parameterized placeholders using the ${} syntax provided by the sql template function.
```

## Medium Risk

### **File:** `src/utils/rateLimitPolyfill.ts`  
**Line:** 100-110  
**Issue:** Rate limiting key includes URL path without sanitization.  
**Risk:** Medium — potential for key collision attacks.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
In src/utils/rateLimitPolyfill.ts, sanitize the URL path before including it in the rate limiting key. Remove query parameters and limit the path length to prevent key manipulation attacks. Use a hash of the sanitized path instead of the raw path.
```

### **File:** `src/middleware/auth.ts`  
**Line:** 25-35  
**Issue:** Authentication middleware logs sensitive information.  
**Risk:** Medium — user credentials and tokens may be logged.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Remove or sanitize console.log statements in src/middleware/auth.ts that may expose sensitive information. Replace detailed logging with generic success/failure messages that don't include user data, tokens, or other sensitive information.
```

### **File:** `src/utils/corsPolyfill.ts`  
**Line:** 25-30  
**Issue:** CORS origin validation is incomplete.  
**Risk:** Medium — potential for CORS bypass attacks.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Enhance CORS origin validation in src/utils/corsPolyfill.ts. Add proper URL validation, protocol checking, and subdomain validation. Ensure that only explicitly allowed origins are permitted and reject any malformed or suspicious origin headers.
```

### **File:** `src/services/loyaltyCardService.ts`  
**Line:** 895-897  
**Issue:** LocalStorage usage without proper validation.  
**Risk:** Medium — potential for XSS attacks through localStorage.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
In src/services/loyaltyCardService.ts, add proper validation and sanitization for localStorage operations. Ensure that only safe, validated data is stored in localStorage and implement proper error handling for localStorage failures.
```

## Low Risk

### **File:** `src/utils/sqlSafety.ts`  
**Line:** 200-210  
**Issue:** String sanitization may be too aggressive.  
**Risk:** Low — may break legitimate functionality.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Review and refine the string sanitization in src/utils/sqlSafety.ts. Ensure that the sanitization doesn't remove legitimate characters while still preventing SQL injection. Test with various input types to ensure functionality isn't broken.
```

### **File:** `src/server.ts`  
**Line:** 25-35  
**Issue:** Excessive console logging in production.  
**Risk:** Low — information disclosure and performance impact.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Implement proper logging levels in src/server.ts. Use a logging library that supports different levels (debug, info, warn, error) and configure it to only log appropriate levels in production. Remove or reduce console.log statements in production builds.
```

### **File:** `src/utils/validateEnvironment.ts`  
**Line:** 100-110  
**Issue:** Environment validation warnings may be too verbose.  
**Risk:** Low — log noise and potential information disclosure.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
Optimize the environment validation logging in src/utils/validateEnvironment.ts. Reduce verbosity in production and ensure that only critical security issues are logged. Consider using structured logging instead of console statements.
```

### **File:** `src/api/feedbackRoutes.ts`  
**Line:** 14, 47, 90  
**Issue:** Request body validation relies on fallback to req.body.  
**Risk:** Low — potential for unvalidated input processing.  

**Fix Prompt:**
```
In src/api/feedbackRoutes.ts, ensure all request body validation uses proper schema validation before processing. Remove fallbacks to req.body and implement strict validation that rejects requests with invalid or missing required fields.
```
