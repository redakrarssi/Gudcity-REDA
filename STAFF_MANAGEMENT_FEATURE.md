- ✅ **Feature Restrictions**: Disable specific actions based on permissions
- ✅ **UI Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for restricted features
- ✅ **Middleware Protection**: Server-side permission validation

### 4. Database Schema
- ✅ **Enhanced Users Table**: Added staff management columns

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Enhanced users table with staff management
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN business_owner_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN permissions JSONB DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id);

-- Activity logging
CREATE TABLE staff_activity_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    staff_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    business_owner_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    resource_type VARCHAR(50),
    resource_id INTEGER,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Permission System

```typescript
// Check permissions
import { hasPermission, PERMISSIONS } from '../utils/permissions';

const canDelete = hasPermission(user, PERMISSIONS.PROGRAMS_DELETE);

// Permission-based components
<PermissionGate permission={PERMISSIONS.PROGRAMS_CREATE}>
  <CreateButton />
</PermissionGate>

<DeleteButton 
  permission={PERMISSIONS.PROGRAMS_DELETE}
  onDelete={handleDelete}
/>
```

### Navigation Filtering

```typescript
// BusinessLayout.tsx - Navigation items are filtered based on user permissions
const menuItems = allMenuItems.filter(item => {
  if (item.requiresOwner && !isBusinessOwner(user)) {
    return false;
  }
  return canAccessNavigation(user, item.path);
});
```

## Security Features

1. **Server-Side Validation**: All permissions checked server-side
2. **JWT Token Enhancement**: Includes role and permissions
3. **Audit Logging**: All staff activities logged
4. **Permission Inheritance**: Staff permissions cannot exceed owner permissions
5. **Secure Password Requirements**: Strong password policy enforced

## Migration from Existing System

For existing business users:
1. All current 'business' role users are automatically upgraded to 'owner' role
2. Existing permissions remain unchanged
3. No data loss or service interruption
4. Staff management is additive functionality
