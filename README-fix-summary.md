- Set proper benefits, points, and multiplier for the card
- Ensured the card appears in the `customer_loyalty_cards` view

### Verification

  1. Tech Points card (STANDARD tier, 100 points)
  2. Fitness Membership card (GOLD tier, 150 points)
- Verified the fitness card appears in the `customer_loyalty_cards` view
- Confirmed the card will be returned by `LoyaltyCardService.getCustomerCards()`
