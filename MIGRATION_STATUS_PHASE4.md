- ✅ Sensitive operations (create): 10 requests/minute per IP
- ✅ 429 responses with retry-after headers

### Input Validation
- ✅ Schema-based validation for POST/PUT requests
- ✅ Type checking (IDs, points, enums)
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- ✅ Length limits on string inputs

### Error Handling
- ✅ Standardized error responses
- ✅ Appropriate HTTP status codes
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages
- ✅ Server-side logging for debugging

## Response Format

All endpoints follow the standardized format:

**Success**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* actual data */ },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Error**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
