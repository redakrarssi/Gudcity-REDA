## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Dashboard is Still Empty

**Check:**
1. Are you logged in? (Token valid?)
2. Check console for specific API errors
3. Check Network tab - are API calls returning data?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check API endpoint directly
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/customers/YOUR_ID/cards \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### If Pricing Page Still Shows Error

**Check:**
1. Console for specific errors
2. Is the page loading at all?

**Solution:**
The pricing page now uses default plans, so it should always work.

### If API Returns 401 Unauthorized

**Solution:**
Log out and log back in to get a fresh token.
