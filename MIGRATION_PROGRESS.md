### ‚è≥ Phase 8: Dashboard Components Update (NOT STARTED)
- Update customer dashboard pages
- Update business dashboard pages
- Update admin dashboard pages
- Update context files

### ‚è≥ Phase 9: Security Hardening & Cleanup (NOT STARTED)
- Remove direct database access from client
- Update environment variables
- Add security headers
- Remove service fallbacks
- Update dependencies

### ‚è≥ Phase 10: Comprehensive Testing (NOT STARTED)
- Authentication testing
- Customer dashboard testing
- Business dashboard testing
- Admin dashboard testing
- Security testing
- Performance testing
- Error handling testing

## Key Features Implemented

### API Client Enhancements
- Comprehensive error handling wrapper
- Retry logic for failed requests (up to 3 retries with exponential backoff)
- Request/response interceptors for logging
- Support for query parameters
- Request timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Proper response format handling
- Token-based authentication

### Server Services Created
1. **Authentication Service** - User login, registration, token management
2. **User Service** - User CRUD operations, search, and filtering
3. **Customer Service** - Customer management and program enrollment
4. **Business Service** - Business profile and settings management
5. **Loyalty Program Service** - Program CRUD and customer management
6. **Loyalty Card Service** - Card management and points tracking
7. **Transaction Service** - Points awarding, redemption, and history
8. **QR Code Service** - QR code generation, processing, and validation
9. **Notification Service** - Notification CRUD and delivery
10. **Analytics Service** - Business, customer, and program analytics
11. **Settings Service** - User, business, and admin settings management

### API Endpoints Created
- **Auth**: login, register, refresh, logout, change-password
- **Users**: CRUD operations, search, by-email, list
- **Customers**: CRUD operations, programs, business customers, enrollment
- **Business**: profile, settings, analytics
- **Loyalty Programs**: CRUD operations, list
- **Loyalty Cards**: CRUD operations, customer cards, activities
- **Transactions**: award points, list, customer transactions, redeem
- **QR Codes**: process, generate, validate, integrity
- **Notifications**: list, read, delete, unread count
- **Analytics**: business analytics, customer analytics
- **Settings**: user settings, business settings

### Client Service Updates
All services now follow this pattern:
1. Try API endpoint first (if `USE_API` flag is enabled)
2. Log any API failures
3. Fall back to direct database access
4. Maintain backward compatibility

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication on all endpoints
- Role-based authorization checks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting (configurable per endpoint)
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Request logging for auditing

## Feature Flags

### `VITE_USE_API`
- **Default**: `true`
- **Purpose**: Controls whether client services use API or direct database access
- **Usage**: Set to `false` to disable API usage and use direct database access
- **Location**: Environment variables

## Testing Status

### Completed
- ‚úÖ No linting errors in created files
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful

### Pending
- ‚è≥ Unit tests for server services
- ‚è≥ Integration tests for API endpoints
- ‚è≥ End-to-end tests for user flows
- ‚è≥ Security testing
- ‚è≥ Performance testing

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 7** - Create remaining 12 server services and their API endpoints
2. **Phase 8** - Update all dashboard components to remove direct database imports
3. **Phase 9** - Security hardening:
   - Block direct database access from client
   - Remove VITE_DATABASE_URL from production
   - Remove fallback logic from services
   - Add comprehensive security headers
4. **Phase 10** - Comprehensive testing of all features

## Notes

- All new server services follow a consistent pattern for easy maintenance
- API responses use standardized format via `responseFormatter.ts`
- Client services maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Feature flag allows gradual rollout and easy rollback
- All endpoints include proper authorization checks
- Database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection

## Estimated Completion

- **Phases 1-6**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Phase 7**: üöß 30% Complete (2 of 12 services done)
- **Phase 8-10**: ‚è≥ Not Started

**Overall Progress**: ~60% Complete

## Breaking Changes

None yet - all changes maintain backward compatibility through fallback mechanisms.

## Known Issues

None reported yet.
