# Test Setup Fix Applied

## Issue

The test setup script was failing with:
```
✗ Failed to create user admin@test.com: column "business_type" of relation "users" does not exist
```

## Root Cause

The `tests/setup-test-data.js` script was trying to insert a `business_type` column that doesn't exist in your actual database schema.

## Fix Applied

**File Modified:** `tests/setup-test-data.js`

### Changes:

1. **Removed `business_type` from INSERT statement**
   - Removed from SQL INSERT columns
   - Removed from VALUES clause

2. **Removed `business_type` from test user data**
   - Removed from business user object

3. **Added 'white' color to color definitions**
   - Fixed console output formatting issue

## Now Run Again

```bash
# This should now work:
npm run test:setup

# Expected output:
# ✓ Created admin: admin@test.com (ID: 1)
# ✓ Created business: business@test.com (ID: 2)
# ✓ Created customer: customer@test.com (ID: 3)
# ✓ Created customer2: customer2@test.com (ID: 4)
```

## After Success

Once test setup succeeds, continue with:

```bash
# 2. Security validation
npm run test:security

# 3. API tests (with dev server running)
npm run dev          # Terminal 1
npm run test:phase10 # Terminal 2
```

## Note

The database schema in your project doesn't include a `business_type` column in the `users` table. The test setup script has been updated to match your actual schema.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed - Ready to run `npm run test:setup` again
