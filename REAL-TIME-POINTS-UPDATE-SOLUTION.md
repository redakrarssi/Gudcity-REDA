# Real-Time Points Update Solution

## Issue
When points are sent to a customer's loyalty program, the points weren't showing up instantly in the customer dashboard. The user wanted:

1. A single notification to appear (working correctly)
2. The program card to show updated points immediately without requiring refresh

## Solution

We simplified the approach to ensure points are updated properly:

1. **Database Update**: Modified `ensureCardPointsUpdated` in `notificationHandler.ts` to:
   - Directly update the card points in the database
   - Use explicit values instead of increments to avoid race conditions
   - Always update both `loyalty_cards` and `program_enrollments` tables

2. **Simple UI Notification**: Created a minimal notification approach:
   - Single localStorage entry with points data
   - Single custom event dispatch
   - No complex sync events

3. **Cards Component**: Updated to:
   - Refetch data when notification is received
   - Provide manual refresh button for user control
   - Remove automatic periodic refreshes

## Testing
To verify the solution:

1. Send points to a customer from a business account
2. Check that a single notification appears in the customer dashboard 
3. Verify the points are immediately shown on the specific program card
4. Test the refresh button to ensure it works as expected

## Future Improvements
- Add WebSockets for true real-time updates
- Implement optimistic UI updates using local state
- Add debug options to help diagnose any issues
