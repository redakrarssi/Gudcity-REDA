# Troubleshooting Admin Businesses Endpoint

## Issues Identified

### 1. **"Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"**
This error indicates that the API endpoint is returning HTML instead of JSON, which typically means:
- The route is not properly registered
- The server is returning an error page
- There's a middleware issue
- The endpoint is not found (404)

### 2. **Console Errors**
- `Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.`
- `Function.prototype.bind called on incompatible undefined`
- `Failed to generate JWT token`
- `operator does not exist: record ->> unknown`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive logging to track request flow
- Added database connection testing
- Added graceful fallbacks for failed database queries
- Added error handling for each business processing step

### 2. **Test Endpoints Added**
- `/api/admin/test` - Basic admin route test
- `/api/admin/public-test` - Public test endpoint (no auth required)
- `/api/admin/simple-businesses` - Simple businesses endpoint (no auth required)
- `/api/admin/businesses` - Full businesses endpoint (auth required)

### 3. **Robust Database Queries**
- Added try-catch blocks around all database operations
- Added fallback data when queries fail
- Added connection testing before processing

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Basic Route Accessibility
```bash
# Test if admin routes are accessible at all
node scripts/test-admin-routes.js
```

### Step 2: Test Individual Endpoints
```bash
# Test public endpoints (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/public-test
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/simple-businesses

# Test auth-required endpoints (will return 401/403)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/businesses
```

### Step 3: Check Server Logs
Look for these log messages in your server console:
```
üîç Admin businesses endpoint accessed
‚úÖ Database connection test successful
üîç Fetching businesses from users table...
‚úÖ Found X businesses in users table
üîç Fetching businesses from businesses table...
‚úÖ Found X businesses in businesses table
üîç Processing business data...
‚úÖ Successfully processed X businesses
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Route Not Found (404)
**Symptoms**: Getting HTML response instead of JSON
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Check if admin routes are imported in `src/api/index.ts`
3. Verify route registration: `router.use('/admin', adminRoutes);`

### Issue 2: Authentication Required (401/403)
**Symptoms**: Getting authentication errors
**Solution**:
1. Ensure you're logged in as an admin user
2. Check if the token is valid
3. Verify user role is 'admin'

### Issue 3: Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms**: Database errors or timeouts
**Solution**:
1. Run the database schema: `psql -d your_database -f db/admin_businesses_schema.sql`
2. Check database connection string
3. Verify all required tables exist

### Issue 4: Missing Tables
**Symptoms**: SQL errors about missing tables
**Solution**:
1. Check if these tables exist:
   - `users`
   - `business_profile`
   - `businesses`
   - `business_daily_logins`
   - `loyalty_programs`
   - `customers`
   - `program_enrollments`
   - `promo_codes`

## Debugging Commands

### Check Server Status
```bash
# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep node

# Check server logs
tail -f server.log
```

### Test Database Connection
```bash
# Test database connection
psql -d your_database -c "SELECT 1 as test;"

# Check table existence
psql -d your_database -c "\dt"
```

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test with curl
curl -v http://localhost:3000/api/admin/public-test

# Test with authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/admin/businesses
```

## Expected Response Format

### Successful Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalBusinesses": 5,
  "businesses": [
    {
      "generalInfo": { /* business details */ },
      "registrationDuration": { /* duration info */ },
      "programs": { /* programs data */ },
      "customers": { /* customers data */ },
      "promotions": { /* promotions data */ },
      "lastLogin": { /* login info */ },
      "timeline": [ /* activity timeline */ ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error description",
  "details": "Additional error details"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script** to identify which endpoints are working
2. **Check server console** for detailed error logs
3. **Verify database tables** exist and are accessible
4. **Test authentication** with a valid admin token
5. **Check network tab** in browser dev tools for actual API responses

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check the server console for detailed error messages
2. Run the test script to isolate the problem
3. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
4. Check if there are any middleware conflicts
5. Ensure the server is running in the correct environment

The enhanced error handling and logging should now provide clear information about what's failing and where the issue occurs.
