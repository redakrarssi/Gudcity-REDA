- Created more efficient event listeners with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Added socket status logging for easier debugging

### 2. Notification System

- Created comprehensive notification schema and database tables
- Implemented real-time notification delivery via WebSockets
- Added notification categories (points added, program enrollments, QR scans, etc.)
- Built approval system for program enrollments and point deductions
- Fixed notification UI components to properly display and update in real-time

### 3. Customer Dashboard Sync

- Fixed card display in customer dashboard to show all enrolled programs
- Ensured proper synchronization between customer_programs and loyalty_cards tables

- Fixed synchronization between program enrollments and business customer lists
- Ensured customer acceptance of program enrollment is reflected in business dashboard
- Added proper management of customer-business relationships

### 5. QR Code Scanning

- Fixed points addition to trigger proper notifications
- Added logging of all QR scans for audit and debugging
- Ensured points awarded through QR scans are immediately reflected in customer accounts
- Fixed QR scan confirmation UI to show correct point balances

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

Several database tables were added or modified:

1. **customer_notifications** - Stores all customer notifications
2. **customer_approval_requests** - Tracks approval requests for actions requiring consent
3. **customer_notification_preferences** - Stores notification preferences
4. **business_customers** - Tracks relationships between businesses and customers
5. **qr_scan_logs** - Records all QR scan activity for auditing and troubleshooting

## üöÄ Usage

Run the fix script to ensure all necessary database tables are created and relationships are synced:

```bash
node fix-qr-scanner-points-final.mjs
```

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

Test the following flows to verify all issues are resolved:

1. **QR Scanning Flow**:
   - Business scans customer QR code
   - Customer receives notification about the scan
   - Points are added to customer account
   - Customer dashboard reflects new points immediately

2. **Program Enrollment Flow**:
   - Business adds a customer to a program
   - Customer receives notification with accept/reject options
   - Upon acceptance, program appears in customer dashboard
   - Business dashboard shows the customer in their customer list

3. **Point Deduction Flow**:
   - Business requests point deduction
   - Customer receives approval request
   - Customer approves/rejects the request
   - Points are updated accordingly in all dashboards

## üìã Notes

- All components now use the socket utility for real-time updates
- The notification context provider handles all real-time updates to UI components
- Query invalidation ensures that the UI displays the latest data
- All data operations are now reflected across the entire platform in real-time
