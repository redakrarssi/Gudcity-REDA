# AI Interaction Guidelines for GudCity REDA Codebase

This document provides rules and guidelines for AI assistance when working with this codebase. These rules help prevent unnecessary changes, maintain code integrity, and avoid disruptions to working functionality.

## DO NOT MODIFY Rules

### Critical Files
- **Service Implementation Files** - Do not modify core service implementations (e.g., `*Service.ts` files) unless specifically requested
- **Database Schema Files** - Do not modify any SQL files or schema definitions in the `db/` directory
- **Authentication Logic** - Do not modify authentication-related code in `src/middleware/auth.ts` and `src/services/authService.ts`

### Working Components
- **QR Scanner Component** - The QR scanner (`src/components/QRScanner.tsx`) is sensitive and should not be modified
- **Business Settings Implementation** - Do not modify the business settings service without explicit instructions
- **Loyalty Card System** - The loyalty card system is critical and requires careful coordination to modify

### Infrastructure Files
- **Configuration Files** - Do not modify the following unless explicitly asked:
  - `vite.config.ts`
  - `tailwind.config.js`
  - `tsconfig.json` files
  - `jest.config.js` files

## SEEK CLARIFICATION Rules

Always seek clarification before modifying:

1. Any file that handles financial transactions or points/rewards calculation
2. Core business logic in services or utilities
3. Database connection and initialization code
4. Authentication flows
5. Files with complex type definitions or generics
6. Files that interface with external systems

## SAFE TO MODIFY Rules

The following can generally be modified safely:

1. Documentation files (like README.md, unless they contain setup instructions)
2. UI components that don't affect business logic (styling changes, layout improvements)
3. Type definitions that make the code more type-safe (without changing behavior)
4. Adding comments or documentation to existing code
5. Fixing obvious bugs that don't affect core functionality

## QR Card Format

The QR card system requires a specific format to ensure compatibility between customer cards and the business scanner. All QR codes must adhere to these requirements:

### Customer QR Card Format
```json
{
  "type": "customer",
  "customerId": "customer-id-value",
  "name": "Customer Name",
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "cardNumber": "GC-XXXXXX-C",
  "cardType": "STANDARD",
  "timestamp": 1234567890123
}
```

### Loyalty Card QR Format
```json
{
  "type": "loyaltyCard",
  "cardId": "card-id-value",
  "customerId": "customer-id-value",
  "programId": "program-id-value",
  "businessId": "business-id-value",
  "cardNumber": "GC-XXXXXX-C",
  "programName": "Program Name",
  "businessName": "Business Name",
  "points": 0,
  "timestamp": 1234567890123
}
```

### Critical QR Requirements
- The `type` field MUST be either "customer" or "loyaltyCard"
- Each QR code MUST have a unique and consistent `cardNumber` for the customer
- The `customerId` field is required for all QR code types
- The business QR scanner requires these specific fields to process rewards and enrollments
- All customer dashboard QR codes should be stored in the database with an image URL
- Digital signatures should be generated for all QR codes for security validation

When modifying any QR code related functionality, ensure these formats are preserved to maintain compatibility between the customer dashboard and business scanner.

## File Size Limitations

For improved maintainability and easier bug fixing:

1. **New Files Size Limit** - New files should not exceed 300 lines of code
2. **File Splitting** - If functionality requires more than 300 lines, split it into multiple files with clear responsibilities
3. **Refactoring Large Files** - When modifying existing large files, consider refactoring into smaller modules
4. **Documentation** - Add clear comments for file relationships when splitting functionality

These limitations help with:
- Easier code understanding and debugging
- More focused unit testing
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced merge conflicts in collaborative development

## Dashboard Synchronization and Real-time Interaction

### Business and Customer Dashboard Sync
- **Real-time Updates** - Ensure changes made in business dashboard reflect immediately in customer dashboard
- **Notification Services** - Use `NotificationService` for real-time communication between dashboards
- **WebSocket Implementation** - Leverage existing WebSocket connections for bidirectional communication
- **Sync Components** - Pay special attention to loyalty points, transaction records, and program enrollments
- **Data Consistency** - Enforce data consistency across business and customer views
- **Optimization Patterns** - Use optimistic UI updates with proper error rollback mechanisms

### Real-time Enrollment Notification System
The enrollment notification system enables business owners to invite customers to join loyalty programs and receive real-time responses:

1. **Business Enrollment Flow**:
   - Business selects a customer and a program to enroll them in
   - System sends a real-time notification to the customer's dashboard
   - Business UI shows a pending state while waiting for customer response
   - Once customer responds, business receives immediate notification of acceptance/rejection

2. **Customer Response Flow**:
   - Customer receives enrollment invitation in their notification center
   - Customer can accept or reject the invitation directly from the notification
   - Upon acceptance, a loyalty card is automatically created and displayed in the customer dashboard
   - Customer is added to the business's customer list

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Uses WebSocket connections for instant notifications in both directions
   - Leverages the `CustomerNotificationService` to handle notification creation and delivery
   - Implements `NotificationContext` for managing real-time notification state
   - Uses React Query for data invalidation and automatic UI updates

4. **Security and Data Integrity**:
   - All enrollment requests require explicit customer approval
   - Customer data is only shared with businesses after consent
   - All enrollment actions are tracked with timestamps and audit logs
   - System maintains consistent state between customer and business views

### Real-time Interaction Best Practices
- **Event-driven Architecture** - Follow the established event patterns for state updates
- **Debouncing** - Implement debouncing for high-frequency update operations
- **Conflict Resolution** - Provide clear conflict resolution strategies when concurrent updates occur
- **Offline Support** - Ensure graceful degradation when real-time connections fail
- **State Management** - Follow existing patterns for state synchronization

## Error and Console Error Handling

### UI Error Handling
- **User-facing Errors** - Ensure all errors are properly caught and presented to users in a friendly manner
- **Error Boundaries** - Use React error boundaries to prevent cascading UI failures
- **Recovery Mechanisms** - Implement recovery paths from common error scenarios

- **Secure Headers** - Configure secure HTTP headers (Content-Security-Policy, etc.)
- **Audit Logging** - Maintain comprehensive audit logs for security-relevant actions

## Best Practices for AI Changes

1. **Incremental Changes** - Make small, focused changes rather than large rewrites
2. **Read Before Writing** - Always analyze existing patterns and code styles before modification
3. **Preserve Type Safety** - Maintain or improve type safety, never reduce it
4. **Test Scenarios** - Before suggesting changes, consider testing implications
5. **Follow Existing Patterns** - Maintain consistency with the existing codebase patterns
6. **Document Changes** - Provide clear explanations for any changes made

## When Making Changes

1. **Indicate Confidence Level** - State how confident you are in the proposed change
2. **Provide Alternatives** - When suggesting significant changes, offer alternatives
3. **Highlight Potential Risks** - Identify any potential side effects of changes
4. **Step-by-Step Approach** - For complex changes, propose a step-by-step implementation plan

## Change Request Format

When requesting AI to make changes, users should follow this format:

```
CHANGE REQUEST:
- Target file: [filename]
- Purpose: [brief description of the change needed]
- Context: [any relevant context about why this change is needed]
- Constraints: [any specific constraints or things to avoid]
```

Following these guidelines will help ensure that AI assistance enhances rather than disrupts the codebase.

## SUCCESSFUL BUG RESOLUTION: 3X MULTIPLICATION FIX

### Problem Identified (December 2024)
**Issue**: When businesses awarded 1 point to customers, the customer's card displayed 3 points instead of 1, indicating a critical multiplication bug in the point awarding system.

**User Report**: "when i send as a business point to a customer par example i send 1 point as an award it reach the customer in his card 3 there is a multiplation somewhere in the database or in the system"

### Root Cause Analysis
Through systematic investigation, the 3x multiplication was traced to a **function call chain** that awarded points multiple times:

1. **`guaranteedAwardPoints`** → **`awardPointsWithCardCreation`** → +1 point ✅ (correct)
2. **`guaranteedAwardPoints`** → **`handlePointsAwarded`** → **`ensureCardPointsUpdated`** → +1 point ❌ (duplicate)
3. **`ensureCardPointsUpdated`** → `program_enrollments` table update → +1 point ❌ (duplicate)

**Total: 3 points awarded for 1 point sent**

### Solution Implemented
**Primary Fix**: Disabled the duplicate point awarding in `src/utils/notificationHandler.ts` line 34:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic):
await ensureCardPointsUpdated(customerId, businessId, programId, points, cardId);

// AFTER (Fixed):
// DISABLED: This was causing 3x multiplication by re-awarding points that were already awarded
// The card points are already properly updated by awardPointsWithCardCreation
// await ensureCardPointsUpdated(customerId, businessId, programId, points, cardId);
```

### Files Modified
- ✅ `src/utils/notificationHandler.ts` - Disabled duplicate point awarding
- ✅ `src/utils/ensureCardExists.ts` - Removed customer_programs update
- ✅ `src/utils/directPointsAward.ts` - Disabled problematic function
- ✅ `src/services/qrCodeService.ts` - Removed auto-awarding
- ✅ PostgreSQL `award_points_to_card()` function - Previously fixed multiplication

### Results Achieved
- ✅ **Perfect 1:1 Ratio**: 1 point sent = 1 point received
- ✅ **3x Multiplication**: ELIMINATED
- ✅ **Cross-card Interference**: ELIMINATED
- ✅ **System Stability**: Maintained all notification functionality

### Key Lessons for Future Development

1. **Point Awarding Protocol**: Only use `awardPointsWithCardCreation` for actual point awarding. Notification functions should NOT re-award points.

2. **Function Chain Analysis**: When investigating multiplication bugs, trace the complete function call chain from UI to database.

3. **Testing Strategy**: Always test point awarding with live database queries to verify exact point amounts.

4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear separation between point awarding logic and notification/UI update logic.

### Future Maintenance Guidelines

- **DO NOT** re-enable `ensureCardPointsUpdated` in the notification flow
- **ALWAYS** use database-level functions for point calculations
- **VERIFY** point accuracy with direct database queries when making changes
- **MAINTAIN** the single-responsibility principle: one function awards points, others handle notifications

This successful resolution demonstrates the importance of systematic root cause analysis and precise surgical fixes that eliminate bugs while preserving system functionality.
