# Customer Dashboard API Consolidation Guide

## Overview
This consolidation reduces the number of serverless functions from 10 to 1, staying within the 12 function limit.

## Consolidated Endpoints
- /api/dashboard
- /api/cards
- /api/promotions
- /api/qr-card
- /api/settings
- /api/notifications
- /api/loyalty/cards/customer
- /api/customers/programs
- /api/users
- /api/security/audit

## Benefits
1. **Function Limit Compliance**: Reduces from 10 functions to 1
2. **Better Performance**: Single handler with shared database connection
3. **Easier Maintenance**: All customer dashboard logic in one place
4. **Cost Effective**: Fewer cold starts and better resource utilization

## Implementation
The consolidated handler is in `customer-dashboard-consolidated.ts` and handles all customer dashboard routes through a single entry point.

## Database Fixes
Run `database-fix.sql` to fix the database schema issues that were causing the errors.

## Testing
